# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?
First and foremost, I'm communicating and that was reflected in my Johari Window responses.  I was also aware that I am responsible and organized, which I feel brings a strong foundation to a project.


* How do you use your strengths as a team member?
As mentioned, I believe my strengths provide a strong foundation for a project.  And by communicating (or possibly overcommunicating!) I help keep the team on the same page with clear expectations of the project and the team.


* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?
The areas that were hidden to me (accountable, hardworking, intelligent) would be good areas to check in on.  Also the areas that were hidden, I need to be more aware of and see how I can practice those traits.


* What are you working to improve on as a teammate? 
Giving and receiving valuable feedback!
